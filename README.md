# Memory-Game
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time.

Rules of Memory Game
You will start by flipping over one card
If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
These cards then disspear

The game continues until you match all the cards on the board

This project was inspired by one of Ania Kubows` tutorials.
